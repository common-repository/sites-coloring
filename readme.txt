Open/close the plugin panel - "Ctrl" + "Z". The panel appears if you are logged in as an administrator.
On the panel, the fields for entering background and text colors, you can enter colors manually or with the mouse cursor in the drop-down palette. You can set up to fifteen background and text colors, which is usually enough.
To simplify the script, the background and text colors are set simultaneously. After setting the color, start coloring the document. The element IDs, tag name, ID, and class are displayed under the mouse cursor. If there is no class and ID, the element will not be colored, except for BODY and links(tag A).
BODY, this is the basis of the page, it is usually colored first, then start with the widest elements, so it is more visible.
For Links, only text is colored, and the background is set to transparent.
To color the body, select a color and click on any element. For coloring links - the same way.
To prevent transitions from interfering with color, there is a button that disables links and transitions - "noLink".
The "CSS reset" button - erase all colorized, the configured colors will remain.
"All reset" button - erase everything and return the original values.
Clicking with the left mouse button - paint the selected item in the selected color. Pressing the right mouse button - removes the color of the painted item, no matter what color is selected.
